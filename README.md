Overview
The challenge
Users should be able to:

View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
Submit their email address using an input field
Receive an error message when the form is submitted if:
The input field is empty. The message for this error should say "Whoops! It looks like you forgot to add your email"
The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: name@host.tld). The message for this error should say "Please provide a valid email address"
